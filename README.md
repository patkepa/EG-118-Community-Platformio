# PUSR EG-118 Example Platformio Code

This repository contains example code for the PUSR EG-118 IoT Device (previously known as USR-100M) for use with Platformio. The goal of this repository is to expand the development potential of the PUSR EG-118, building a community-driven resource to enhance compatibility with Arduino and Platformio environments.

### USR_IO Library Information
The USR_IO library file in this repository is owned by PUSR Corporation and included here solely for demonstration and compatibility purposes, as the library does not have its own repository. For the latest version and official updates, the library can be downloaded directly from the PUSR EG-118 product page.

### Community Development
This repository is open for community contributions to broaden the use and capabilities of the EG-118 board, specifically to enhance integration with Arduino and Platformio. Contributions that improve library compatibility, introduce new features, and optimize functionality are welcome.

### Future Roadmap
- [ ] Network Manager: Development of a Network Manager module compatible with the onboard Ethernet chip to streamline network setup and management for projects.
